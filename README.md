# Multiple Languages for e107 v2.
With this plugin you can have your news, pages and faqs all copied across from your default language table automatically, each and every time you create or update them.
It is designed specifically for when you wish to have a mirror of your existing site in another language.
Also includes tools to quickly create multi-language sitelinks (and preferences - coming soon).

Usage:

News and Page items are automatically assigned the "TRANSLATE_ME" class when copied from the original language.
Translators simply login in their language, translate and save the item and then change the userclass to any other userclass.
This tells the 'Multiple Languages' plugin that this item has been translated. Further changes to this item in the original site-language will no longer overwrite or affect the translated record. (these would need to be done manually)
